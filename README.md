## Project Setup

### Tools & Libraries

- **Vite + TypeScript Template:** Chosen for its fast build times and built-in TypeScript support.
- **Prettier:** Added for consistent code formatting, ensuring all contributors follow the same coding style.

### Git Hooks & Automation

- **Husky:** Configured pre-commit hooks to automatically run scripts before a commit.
- **Lint-Staged:** Used alongside Husky to lint and format staged files before committing, preventing formatting and linting errors from being accidentally pushed to the repository.
